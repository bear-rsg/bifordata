        BIFoR FACE is a Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment facility in Staffordshire (UK), the second such facility worldwide, and the only one in the Northern Hemisphere. We are pumping CO2 around trees to simulate the atmosphere we’re predicted to have in 2050. This helps us see how the woodland responds – do the trees grow faster, locking away more carbon, will there be changes to the soil and forest ecosystem? Recognised with awards for its sensitive construction and low-impact integration into the existing woodland, the facility enables the much needed real world experiment to improve our climate projections and evaluate risks to forest ecosystems and the services they provide. The facility is jointly funded by the JABBS foundation and the University of Birmingham.
